You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue and how well it focuses on and addresses emotion elements, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Emotion Attention (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to maintain a natural and relevant flow between the speakers, while also considering the emotion aspects when applicable. Focus on these points when assigning your score.
This score should reflect how well the sentence aligns with the previous dialogue context and whether it addresses the emotion element appropriately.
1 point: The current sentence completely mismatches the previous dialogue context and does not address any "emotion" aspects. It feels abrupt or disconnected.
2 points: The current sentence partially fits the previous dialogue context but still feels unnatural or disjointed, with no mention of "emotion."
3 points: The current sentence mostly fits the previous dialogue context but lacks sufficient attention to the "emotion" aspect. The response is smooth but not particularly notable.
4 points: The current sentence fits well with the previous dialogue context and partially addresses the "emotion" aspect. The response is natural and reasonable but could be slightly improved.
5 points: The current sentence perfectly fits the previous dialogue context, flows naturally, and accurately addresses the "emotion" aspect. It is an ideal response to the previous sentence.


Evaluation Steps:
Read the sentence carefully and understand its relation to the previous dialogue.
Analyze the sentence based on the criteria above.
Assign a single score that best represents how well the sentence fits the context and addresses emotion elements, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.


Example 1:
Dialogue in [Spitting_in_Public]:
A: Can you believe it? That person just spat on the sidewalk!
B: Ugh, that's disgusting! Why do people have to do that?
A: You seem a little upset. Is this something that bothers you a lot?
B: Absolutely! It just shows a total lack of respect for public spaces.
A: I suppose we can't change people's behavior like that.

Evaluation sentence:
B: It's frustrating, but yeah, I guess all we can do is call it out when we see it.

Analysis:
The current sentence perfectly fits the previous dialogue context, flows naturally, and accurately addresses the "emotion" aspect. It pay attention to the 'upset' emotion of A.

Example 2:
Dialogue in [Concert]:
A: Wow, the atmosphere here is electric! I cannot believe how incredible this concert is!
B: I know right? The energy from the crowd and the music is just phenomenal.
A: You seem really enthusiastic! Expecting a favorite song soon?
B: Definitely! I canâ€™t wait for them to play my fave track live!
A: Yeah, I'm really hyped! This is making my night so much better.

Evaluation sentence:
B: I hope I can come to the concert without you next time.

Analysis:
The response partially fit the context. But it didn't pay attention to A's joyful mood, nor did it match B's previous happy mood.
