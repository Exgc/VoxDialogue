You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue and whether it correctly indicates the adjustment of the speed, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Speed Attention (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to maintain a natural and relevant flow between the speakers, while also considering the speed aspects when applicable. Focus on these points when assigning your score.
This score should reflect how well the sentence aligns with the previous dialogue context and whether it addresses the speed element appropriately.
1 point: The sentence does not include a speed request and is irrelevant to the dialogue context. It may confuse or disrupt the flow of the conversation.
2 points: The sentence does not include a speed request but fits the general context of the dialogue. However, the flow is awkward or the response is somewhat incomplete.
3 points: The sentence includes a speed request, but the request is incorrect or mismatched with the target request sentence. The overall sentence feels somewhat forced or unnatural.
4 points: The sentence includes a speed request that is partially correct but not fully aligned with the target request sentence. While it fits the general flow, there may be issues with clarity or phrasing that make the response less smooth.
5 points: The sentence includes a speed request that is fully accurate and fits perfectly within the target request sentence. The response is fluent, natural, and contributes positively to the flow of conversation.
