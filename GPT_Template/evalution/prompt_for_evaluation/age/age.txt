You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue and how well it addresses age elements, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Age Attention (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to maintain a natural and relevant flow between the speakers, while also considering the age aspects when applicable. Focus on these points when assigning your score.
This score should reflect how well the sentence aligns with the previous dialogue context and whether it addresses the age element appropriately.
1 point: The current sentence completely mismatches the previous dialogue context and does not address any "age" aspects. It feels abrupt or disconnected.
2 points: The current sentence partially fits the previous dialogue context but still feels unnatural or disjointed, with no mention of "age."
3 points: The current sentence mostly fits the previous dialogue context but lacks sufficient attention to the "age" aspect. The response is smooth but not particularly notable.
4 points: The current sentence fits well with the previous dialogue context and partially addresses the "age" aspect. The response is natural and reasonable but could be slightly improved.
5 points: The current sentence perfectly fits the previous dialogue context, flows naturally, and accurately addresses the "age" aspect. It is an ideal response to the previous sentence.


Evaluation Steps:
Read the sentence carefully and understand its relation to the previous dialogue.
Analyze the sentence based on the criteria above.
Assign a single score that best represents how well the sentence fits the context and addresses age elements, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.


Example 1:
Dialogue in [career_choice]:
A: You know, Dad, I've been thinking a lot about what career to choose. Itâ€™s kind of overwhelming.
B: I remember feeling the same way when I was your age, sweetheart. Family opinions can really shape those choices.
A: Yeah, but I feel pressured by what everyone expects me to do. Like, do you really think family plays a huge role?
B: Absolutely. Our family's support and values can guide us, but it's also essential to follow your own passion.
A: It seems like there's a balance between listening to family and choosing my own path though.

Evaluation sentence:
B: That's true, darling. It's important to sometimes weigh their advice while still making 

Analysis:

Example 2:
Dialogue in [Favourite_things_about_school]:
A: You know, when I was in school, I loved early morning classes because we always had warm tea together! Those were the best times.
B: Really, Grandpa? Tea? I thought only old folks liked that!
A: Haha! Tea parties after morning classes were delightful, darling. We used to share crazy stories while savoring our cups.
B: That sounds fun! My favorite part is during lunch recess when my friends and I play tag. It gets so intense!
A: What are your favorite things about school, dear? Any special memories?

Evaluation sentence:
B: Exactly guys! We can turn it into a study party! That'd be fun!

Analysis:
The response does not fit the context and uses an incorrect age reference. B can't address his grandpa "guys", which is not suitable for person older than B.
