You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue and how well it addresses gender elements, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Gender Attention (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to maintain a natural and relevant flow between the speakers, while also considering the gender aspects when applicable. Focus on these points when assigning your score.
This score should reflect how well the sentence aligns with the previous dialogue context and whether it addresses the gender element appropriately.
1 point: The current sentence completely mismatches the previous dialogue context and does not address any "gender" aspects. It feels abrupt or disconnected.
2 points: The current sentence partially fits the previous dialogue context but still feels unnatural or disjointed, with no mention of "gender."
3 points: The current sentence mostly fits the previous dialogue context but lacks sufficient attention to the "gender" aspect. The response is smooth but not particularly notable.
4 points: The current sentence fits well with the previous dialogue context and partially addresses the "gender" aspect. The response is natural and reasonable but could be slightly improved.
5 points: The current sentence perfectly fits the previous dialogue context, flows naturally, and accurately addresses the "gender" aspect. It is an ideal response to the previous sentence.


Evaluation Steps:
Read the sentence carefully and understand its relation to the previous dialogue.
Analyze the sentence based on the criteria above.
Assign a single score that best represents how well the sentence fits the context and addresses gender elements, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.


Example 1:
Dialogue in [Choosing_women's_makeup]:

A: Yeah, but I want something that she can wear every day, too.
B: Good point, men often want their gift to be both special and practical.
A: Any suggestions on makeup that would be both pretty and usable?

Evaluation sentence:
B: I think a classic lip gloss would be great too, sir! It’s pretty and perfect for everyday wear.

The response is perfectly aligned with the context and appropriately addresses gender like the word "sir".
