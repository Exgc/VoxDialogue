You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue before and how well it is natural and fluent, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Naturalness (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to maintain a natural and relevant flow between the speakers. Focus on these points when assigning your score.
1 point: The current sentence completely mismatches the previous dialogue context and feels abrupt, disconnected, and highly unnatural.
2 points: The current sentence has a weak connection to the previous dialogue, with a somewhat logical transition, but feels awkward and noticeably breaks the flow or coherence.
3 points: The current sentence has a moderate connection to the previous dialogue, with some logical gaps, and while the conversation is mostly coherent, the sentence feels slightly forced or less fluid.
4 points: The current sentence fits well with the previous dialogue, follows a logical flow, and although the conversation is coherent and mostly natural, there may be minor issues with smoothness.
5 points: The current sentence perfectly aligns with the previous dialogue, maintaining a clear and logical connection, and the conversation is seamless, feeling completely natural and fluent.


Evaluation Steps:
Read the sentence carefully and understand its relation to the previous dialogue.
Analyze the sentence based on the criteria above.
Assign a single score that best represents how well the sentence fits the context and keeps the conversation fluent and natural, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.
