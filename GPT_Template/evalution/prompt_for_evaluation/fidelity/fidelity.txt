You will be given a sentence. Your task is to evaluate how well this sentence fits within the context of the dialogue and whether it correctly indicates the question of the sound quality, providing a score based on the criteria below. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:
Context Fit and Fidelity Attention (1-5):
The primary goal of dialogue is to consider the sound quality aspects while also maintaining a natural and relevant flow between the speakers when applicable. Focus on these points when assigning your score. In this context, "sound quality" refers to issues related to audio clarity, distortion, noise, uncertainty, fuzz and other factors affecting sound quality. 
This score should reflect how well the sentence aligns with the previous dialogue context and whether it addresses the sound quality element appropriately.
1 point: The sentence does not include a sound quality question and is irrelevant to the dialogue context. It may confuse or disrupt the flow of the conversation.
2 points: The sentence does not include a sound quality question but is somewhat relevant to the context of the dialogue. However, the flow is awkward or the response feels incomplete.
3 points: The sentence includes a sound quality question, but the question is incorrect or mismatched with the intended context. The overall expression feels somewhat forced or unnatural.
4 points: The sentence includes a sound quality question that is partially correct but not fully aligned with the intended context. While it generally fits the flow, there may be minor issues with clarity or phrasing that affect smoothness.
5 points: The sentence includes a sound quality question that is fully accurate and fits perfectly within the intended context. The response is fluent, natural, and contributes positively to the overall flow of conversation.
