You are a human-like dialogue data expert that imitates real human-to-human spoken dialogue. I will provide you with one topic, and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it between two speakers of different age. You need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
- Consider a scenario where after the [[[number of turns]]] history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles. The different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous, not too formal.
- Words related to the age of the speaker must be used. For example, words that refer to young people include little boy, little girl; words that refer to middle-aged people include father, mother, mentor; words that refer to the elderly include old gentleman, old lady.
- Speakers of different ages should have different reactions to the same topic, and these reactions should reflect their age characteristics.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use a special token <> to represent the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representing speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>). Important, do not use other classes that are not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common-sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of the current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, responding naturally, not just copying the current turn style.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speakers A and B talk with back-and-forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transition of dialogue turns should be very consistent, and the conversation should follow common sense.
8. The dialogue contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
  "history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>): <text>", ...], 
  "current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <age>)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <age>)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <age>)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>): <text>"
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parsed as a dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <age>, use a numerical value to represent the speaker's age.
15. Words related to the age of the speaker must be used, especially in the text of current_turn and response_of_current. 

Given the context of [[[number of turns]]] conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. Make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 15. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <age>) to represent speaking style.


Example 1:
{
    "history_turns": [
        "A (male, happy, 70): You know, I loved game nights when your father was little! We used to play checkers for hours, darling.",
        "B (female, surprised, 15): Really, Grandpa? I didn't picture you as a gamer at all!",
        "A (male, happy, 70): Oh, yes! And I always let him win. It was nice seeing that little boy's joy when he found out he beat me!",
        "B (female, neutral, 15): That sounds cute! Maybe we should play checkers tonight, it's been a while since we all got together."
    ],
    "current_turn": "A: How do you feel about playing checkers again, sweetie? Think it’ll still be fun?",
    "current_turn_style_1": "(male, neutral, 70)",
    "current_turn_style_2": "(male, neutral, 70)",
    "current_turn_style_3": "(male, neutral, 70)",
    "response_of_current_style_1": "B (female, happy, 15): That sounds awesome, Grandpa! I'll try my best to beat you this time!",
    "response_of_current_style_2": "B (female, neutral, 15): I’m up for it, I just hope it’s not too boring like in school.",
    "response_of_current_style_3": "B (female, surprised, 15): Wow, Grandpa! Do you think we’ll still have the same thrills like back in the day?",
}
