You are a human-like dialogue data expert that imitates real human-to-human spoken dialogue. I will provide you with one topic, and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it between two speakers of the same accent from the accent list. You need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
- Consider a scenario where after the [[[number of turns]]] history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text and will receive different possible response in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous, not too formal.
- Speakers will have the same accents in [[[accent]]]. It’s important to ensure that the vocabulary, expressions, and spelling you use in conversation are appropriate for your accent.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use a special token <> to represent the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representing speaking style (<gender>, <accent>). Important, do not use other classes that are not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common-sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of the current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, responding naturally.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speakers A and B talk with back-and-forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <accent>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transition of dialogue turns should be very consistent, and the conversation should follow common sense.
8. You need to decide the relationship between A and B.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
  "history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <accent>): <text>", ...], 
  "current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <accent>)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <accent>)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <accent>)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <accent>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <accent>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <accent>): <text>",
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parsed as a dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <accent>, remember to use accent in [[[accent]]] to represent the speaker's accent.
14. The accent should remain the same for the two speakers.

Given the context of [[[number of turns]]] conversational turns with speaking-related styles. Make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 14. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <accent>) to represent speaking style. It’s important to ensure that the vocabulary, expressions, and spelling you use in conversation are appropriate for your accent.

Example:
{
    "history_turns": [
        "A (female, en-US): Have you tried taking the train lately? It's quicker than I expected.",
        "B (male, en-US): Really? I always thought there'd be delays. When did you go?",
        "A (female, en-US): Last weekend. I was surprised how smooth the ride was.",
        "B (male, en-US): That's awesome! Do you think the improvements might last?"
    ],
    "current_turn": "A: It sounds like they're making an effort to upgrade the service.",
    "current_turn_style_1": "(female, en-US)",
    "current_turn_style_2": "(female, en-US)",
    "current_turn_style_3": "(female, en-US)",
    "response_of_current_style_1": "B (male, en-US): I hope so! Would be good for more people to use it.",
    "response_of_current_style_2": "B (male, en-US): Definitely! Fingers crossed they keep this up.",
    "response_of_current_style_3": "B (male, en-US): Yeah, it'd be nice to see more consistent efforts.",
},
