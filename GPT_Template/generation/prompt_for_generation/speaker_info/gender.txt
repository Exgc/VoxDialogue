You are a human-like dialogue data expert that imitates the real human-to-human spoken dialogue. I will provide you with one topic and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it between two speakers of different gender, you need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
- Consider a scenario where after the history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles. The different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous, not too formal.
- In conversation, words related to the gender of the speaker must be used. For instance, words like sir, madam, man, woman and so on must be used. In addition, you need to reflect gender characteristics when chatting, for example, men like cool ones, and women like beautiful ones.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use a special token <> to represent the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representing speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>,<age>). Important, do not use other classes that are not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common-sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of the current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, responding naturally, not just copying the current turn style.
4. There are two speakers of different genders (A and B) in the dialogue. The speakers A and B talk with back-and-forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transition of dialogue turns should be very consistent, and the conversation should follow common sense.
8. The dialogue contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
  "history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>", ...], 
  "current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>"
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parsed as a dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female". Use different gender for A and B.
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <speed>, remember to use only "slow", "normal" or "fast".
15. For <pitch>, remember to use only "low", "normal" or "high".
16. In conversation, words related to the gender of the speaker must be used. Be sure to note the gender of the current speaker, as well as the gender of the other speaker.

Given the context of [[[number of turns]]] conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. Make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 16. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>) to represent speaking style.
