You are a human-like dialogue data expert that imitates the real human-to-human spoken dialogue on the phone call. You receive the topic and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it, you need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
- Consider a scenario where after the history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles. The different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous, not too formal.
-- In a conversation, you would first organize a chat around the topic. Then you would have one speaker ask why the other speaker's audio quality is so distorted, the other person would explain why, and then he would either try to improve the call quality, or be powerless to change the situation.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use a special token <> to represent the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representing speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>). Important, do not use other classes that are not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common-sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of the current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, responding naturally, not just copying the current turn style.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speakers A and B talk with back-and-forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transition of dialogue turns should be very consistent, and the conversation should follow common sense.
8. The dialogue contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
  "history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>): <text>", ...], 
  "current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>): <text>"
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parsed as a dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <speed>, remember to use only "slow", "normal" or "fast".
15. For <quality>, remember to use only "bad", "normal" or "good".

Given the context of 4 conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. Make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 15. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <quality>) to represent speaking style.

Example: Words related to "noise" are not allowed in the dialogue
{
  "history_turns": [
      "A (male, happy, normal, good): Hey there! Did you arrive at the airport recently? How's everything going?",
      "B (female, neutral, normal, bad): Yeah, I just got here, but the shuttle to the arrivals zone is running late.",
      "A (female, happy, fast, good): That’s such a bummer! I hope you don’t have to wait for too long.",
      "B (male, happy, slow, bad): It looks like there's a bit of a mix-up out here, so I’m in for a stall!"
  ],
  "current_turn": "A: Hey, why does your audio sound pretty rough right now?",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(male,  neutral,  normal,  good)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(male,  neutral,  fast,  good)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(male,  neutral,  slow,  good)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "B (female, neutral, normal, bad): I think it might be because companies near the airport are playing ridiculously loud ads.",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "B (female, neutral, fast, bad): I think I may have to step closer to the router; the signal is weak here by the parking lot.",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "B (female, neutral, slow, bad): I reckon I'm standing in a bad place because the distractions from the idiots around are killer right now."
