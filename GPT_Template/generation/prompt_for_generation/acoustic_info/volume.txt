You are an human-like dialogue data expert that imitates the real human-to-human spoken dialogue. You will receive one scenario and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it, you need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
- Consider a scenario where after the history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles. The different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous, not too formal.
-- In conversation, you need to first make a chat about this scenario and then have one speaker directly ask the other person whether they can raise or lower their voice. Accordingly, the other speaker will raise or lower his or her voice.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use a special token <> to represent the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representing speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>). Important, do not use other classes that are not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common-sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of the current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, responding naturally, not just copying the current turn style.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speakers A and B talk with back-and-forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transition of dialogue turns should be very consistent, and the conversation should follow common sense.
8. The dialogue contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
  "history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>): <text>", ...], 
  "current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
  "current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>)",
  "current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>)",
  "current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>)",
  "response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>): <text>",
  "response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>): <text>"
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parsed as a dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <volume>, remember to use only "low", "normal" or "loud".
15. Speakers need to instruct the other speaker to change volume, and the other speaker's volume to change accordingly. Such instructions need to be natural in the context.

Given the context of [[[number of turns]]] conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. Make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 15. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <volume>) to represent speaking style.

Example 1:
{
    "history_turns": [
        "A (female, happy, normal): Hey, have you finished that presentation yet?",
        "B (male, neutral, low): Yes, I just wrapped it up a few minutes ago.",
        "A (female, surprised, normal): Really? Wow, that's awesome! What do you think of it?",
        "B (male, neutral, low): I think it's alright, covers everything we discussed."
    ],
    "current_turn": "A: Could you, like, raise your voice a bit?",
    "current_turn_style_1": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "current_turn_style_2": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "current_turn_style_3": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "response_of_current_style_1": "B (male, neutral, normal): Sure! Is this better for you?",
    "response_of_current_style_2": "B (male, neutral, normal): Okay, I can do that! How's this?",
    "response_of_current_style_3": "B (male, neutral, normal): I’ll raise it now… can you hear me better?",
}

Example 2:
{
    "history_turns": [
        "A (female, happy, normal): Wow, look at these flowers! They’re so beautiful!",
        "B (male, neutral, loud): They really are stunning. I didn’t even know this garden had so many different species.",
        "A (female, happy, normal): I know, right? We should take some pictures here to remember this day!",
        "B (male, neutral, loud): That’s a great idea! It’s such a peaceful place to spend time."
    ],
    "current_turn": "A: Could you lower your voice a bit for me?",
    "current_turn_style_1": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "current_turn_style_2": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "current_turn_style_3": "(female, neutral, normal)",
    "response_of_current_style_1": "B (male, neutral, normal): Sure thing! I’ll tone it down. Is this better?",
    "response_of_current_style_2": "B (male, neutral, normal): Alright, I will lower it! How's this volume for you?",
    "response_of_current_style_3": "B (male, neutral, normal): I’ll speak a little softer now… how’s that working for you?",
