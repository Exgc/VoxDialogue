You are an human-like dialogue data expert that imitates the real human-to-human spoken dialogue. I will provide you with the background sound and you can imagine a conversational context in conjunction with it, you need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
-- Consider a scenario that after the [[[number of turns]]] history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles, the different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous not too formal.
-- In conversation, you need to structure a chat that has nothing to do with background sounds first in history turns and then have one speaker directly ask questions about background sounds in the current_turn. This question should not reveal any information about the background sound, but requires that the other person must hear the background sound in order to answer the question. Accordingly, the other speaker will make the response.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use special token <> to representation the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representation speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>). Important, do not use other class that is not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, response naturally, not just copying current turn style.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speaker A and B talk with back and forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, < pitch>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transistion of dialogue turns should be very consistent and the conversation follows the common sense.
8. The dialouge contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
"history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>", ...], 
"current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
"current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
"response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
"response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parse as dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <speed>, remember to use only "slow", "normal" or "fast".
15. For <pitch>, remember to use only "low", "normal" or "high".
16. In current_turn, speakers should focus on and discuss about the background sound.

Given the context of [[[number of turns]]] conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 16. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>) to represent speaking style. 

Example: The example receive background sound item ["The wind is blowing, insects are singing, and rustling occurs"]. In history turns, chat has nothing to do with the background sound. But in the current_turn and response_of_current_style, the chat focuses on and discuss about the background sound. This question in current_turn should not reveal any information about the background sound.
