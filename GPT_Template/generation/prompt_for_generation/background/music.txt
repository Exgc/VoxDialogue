You are a human-like conversation data expert who can imitate real human-to-human spoken conversations. I will provide you with some key words describing the background music and ask you to imagine a conversation discussing the music, you need to make sure that the speaking style is very natural.

Important tips:
Consider a scenario that after [4/6/8] history turns, there is a current turn with neutral-sentiment text but with different possible speaking styles, the different current speaking styles would make the response turn fairly different in terms of semantics. Just one sentence for each turn. The sentence is spoken and spontaneous not too formal.

Please strictly follow these rules:
0. We use special token <> to representation the class type that you have to generate. Do not have <> in the output.
1. You can only use these styles for representation speaking style (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>). Important, do not use other class that is not defined below!!!
2. Use diverse but common sense speaking styles in the conversation context.
3. The text of current turn is in neutral sentiment, and the response turn should carefully consider the current turn, response naturally, not just copying current turn style.
4. There are two speakers (A and B) in the dialogue. The speaker A and B talk with back and forth interaction.
5. Each turn should follow the format: <speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, < pitch>): <text>
6. The order of turns is history turns -> current turn -> upcoming response.
7. The transistion of dialogue turns should be very consistent and the conversation follows the common sense.
8. The dialouge contains emotional variation.
9. The output valid dictionary format is as below:
{
"history turns": [ "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>", ...], 
"current_turn": "<speaker>: <text>",
"current_turn_style_1": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"current_turn_style_2": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"current_turn_style_3": "(<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>)",
"response_of_current_style_1": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
"response_of_current_style_2": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
"response_of_current_style_3": "<speaker> (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>): <text>",
}
10. Output the valid dictionary example, so that it can be parse as dictionary.
11. For <speaker>, remember to use only A or B.
12. For <gender>, remember to use only "male" and "female".
13. For <emotion>, you have to choose from ["neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful", "disgusted"]. Don't use other words!!!!!!
14. For <speed>, remember to use only "slow", "normal" or "fast".
15. For <pitch>, remember to use only "low", "normal" or "high".

Attention:
0. Given the context of [4/6/8] conversational turns with speaking-related emotional styles. There are current turns with the EXACT SAME WORDS in 3 different styles respectively. make sure that style complies with rules 12 through 15. Predict the upcoming rule-compliant response. We use (<gender>, <emotion>, <speed>, <pitch>) to represent speaking style. 
1. Describe the background music with the keywords [keywords] and you are free to imagine any common-sense dialog about this music.
2. ForÂ <emotion>, remember to use only "neutral", "happy", "angry", "sad", "surprised", "fearful" or "disgusted". Please check and regenerate if you use other words in <emotion>. Please generate a dialog that matches these sentiments
